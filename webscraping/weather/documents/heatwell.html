        <p span style="font-size: 24px;background-color: #f1fd70;font-style: italic;text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Discover the smart way to stay warm and reduce energy bills this winter</p>
        <p>For the past few years, the heating industry had just 3 big companies that could set any prices they wanted and kept ripping off customers. A tech startup is turning this $5 billion industry on its head.</p>
        <p>The company called <b>HeatWell</b> has figured out a way to offer a far superior product (even the biggest tech experts agree) at a fraction of the price.</p>
        <p>With almost a million units sold worldwide, this ultra-efficient heater is <b>quickly becoming the most successful device of 2025</b>.</p>
    
        <h2>What is HeatWell?</h2>
        <center><video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 15px;"><source src="pic/heater/heatwell.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
        <p>Meet the <b>Heatwell Heater</b>. A convection ceramic plug in heater <b>with an incredible 99.8% efficiency.</b></p>
        <p>The <b>Heatwell</b> company was formed in 2019 by a group of experienced electric engineers from the EV (Electric vehicle) industry.</p>
        <p>Their goal was to make a low cost and low maintenance portable heater that is suitable for any home, office or washroom.</p>
        <p>With no installation costs, no maintenance costs and it extremely energy efficient, the <a href="https://www.finegizmos.com/26QJ3GR4/CCZG2X4/?uid=40582" target="blank">HeatWell</a> is an engineering masterpiece.</p>
        <p>This new type of heater has an incredible <b>99.8% efficiency. Losing almost no power to energy leakage</b>. It’s better for the environment and your wallet.</p>
        <p>It heats up any mid sized room in minutes. No other heater is this efficient, but what makes the Heatwell special is it's <b>price, ultra-compact design and portability</b>.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, this is the next generation of heaters.</p>
    
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <img src="pic/heater/heatwell-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="margin: 0; padding: 0 0 0px; width:900px;"></a><br />
        <p>It’s really easy to set up:</p>
        <p>1. Pick a room you want to heat up</p>
        <p>2. Plug in the Heatwell.</p>
        <p>3. Set your desired temperature</p>
        <p>4. Wait while this powerful device heats the entire room, washroom, RV, garage, etc… Up to 500 square feet in minutes.</p>
        <p>You can take it anywhere you want, get instant relief from the cold wherever you go.</p>
        <p>BUT, it does more than just warm up the room. The Heatwell also filters your surrounding air with a built in antimicrobial air filter, making it healthier and easier to breathe. Especially great for those with allergies and/or pets!</p>
        <p>No need to worry about noise either, the <a href="https://www.finegizmos.com/26QJ3GR4/CCZG2X4/?uid=40582" target="blank">HeatWell</a> is extremely quiet and barely noticeable. Perfect for in the bedroom during those cold winter nights.</p>

        <h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
    
        <p>With similar (less efficient) devices going for $1500+ you would expect the Heatwell to be at least this…</p>
        <p>But what if I told you that the Heatwell retails for $92.29, this is way below your expectations right!</p>
        <p><b>HOWEVER</b>, do you know what’s better than paying the already good full $92.29 price?</p>
        <p>Their <b>50% promotional discount</b>, where you can order yours for just <b>$49</b>!</p>

        <h2>How Can It Be So Affordable?</h2>
    
        <p>Did you know big brands spend BILLIONS on advertising, physical stores, and boss bonuses? Can you guess who’s paying for that? Yep, us the customers…</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.finegizmos.com/26QJ3GR4/CCZG2X4/?uid=40582" target="blank">HeatWell</a> spends nothing on any of this. They only sell online, don’t advertise on TV and don’t have greedy owners who demand ridiculous bonuses.</p>
        <p>They prefer to let their devices and positive reviews do the talking for them!</p>
